written in 1739 and published in 1750, in which he derived for
the first time, the differential equation of the (undamped)
simple harmonic oscillator under harmonic excitation, namely the
motion of an object acted on by two forces, one proportional to
the distance traveled, the other varying sinusoidally with time.
He then developed a general solution, using two different methods
of integration, making extensive use of direct and inverse sine
and cosine functions. After much manipulation of the resulting
equations, he proceeded to an analysis of the periodicity of the
solutions by varying the relation between two parameters,
$$a$$and $$b$$, eventually identifying the phenomenon of
resonance in the case where $$2b=a$$. This is shown to be nothing
more than the equality between the driving frequency and the
natural frequency of the oscillator, which, indeed, characterizes
the phenomenon of resonance. Graphical representations of the
behavior of the oscillator for different relations between these
parameters are given. Despite having been a brilliant discovery,
Euler's publication was not influential and has been neglected by
scholars and by specialized publications alike.},

Königsberg in eastern Prussia with two small islands in the
Pregel River, and a seventh bridge linked the two islands

and others to ponder the solution to a problem which was trivial
but seemed to offer no logical solution. The problem stemmed
from a puzzle involving the seven bridges: namely, how to cross
all seven bridges in a single journey without crossing any
bridge more than once. This puzzle withstood countless efforts
to solve it until the mathematician Euler simplified the problem
by reducing it to a graph with vertices and arcs to illustrate
the bridges, and then attempting to traverse these with a
continuous line starting and ending at the same point. Is there
a solution to the problem as stated above? What did Euler
discover in the way of mathematical proof concerning this
problem? Euler is generally credited with inventing the branch

into an autonomous discipline and reorganize the whole of
mathematics around it. The implementation of this program
presented many difficulties, and the result was not entirely
satisfactory. Many of these difficulties concerned the integral
calculus. In this paper, we deal with some topics relevant to
understand Euler's conception of analysis and how he developed
and implemented his program. In particular, we examine Euler's
contribution to the construction of differential equations and
his notion of indefinite integrals and general integrals. We
also deal with two remarkable difficulties of Euler's program.
The first concerns singular integrals, which were considered as
paradoxical by Euler since they seemed to violate the generality
of certain results. The second regards the explicitly use of the
geometric representation and meaning of definite integrals,
which was gone against his program. We clarify the nature of
these difficulties and show that Euler never thought that they
undermined his conception of mathematics and that a different
foundation was necessary for analysis.]},

Mengoli (1626–1686) had computed such integrals for natural and
half-integer exponents in his Geometriae Speciosae Elementa

triangular tables. In particular, his new arithmetic-algebraic
method allowed him to compute the quadrature of the circle. The
aim of this article is to show how Mengoli calculated the values
of these integrals as well as how he analysed the relation
between these values and the exponents inside the integrals.
This analysis provides new insights into Mengoli's view of his

 abstract = {[The English concertina, invented by the physicist Charles
Wheatstone, enjoyed a modest popularity as a parlor and concert
instrument in Victorian Britain. Wheatstone designed several
button layouts for the concertina consisting of pitch lattices
of interlaced fifths and thirds, which he described in patents
of 1829 and 1844. Like the later tonal spaces of the German
dualist theorists, the concertina's button layouts were inspired
by the work of eighteenth-century mathematician Leonhard Euler,
who used a lattice to show relationships among pitches in just
intonation. Wheatstone originally tuned the concertina according
to Euler's diatonic-chromatic genus before switching to meantone
and ultimately equal temperament for his commercial instruments.
Among members of the Royal Society, the concertina became an
instrument for research on acoustics and temperament. Alexander
Ellis, translator of Hermann von Helmholtz's On the Sensations
of Tone, used the concertina as a demonstration tool in public
lectures intended to popularize Helmholtz's acoustic theories.
The English concertina's history reveals the peculiar fissures
and overlaps between scientific and popular cultures,
speculative harmonics and empirical acoustics, and music theory
and musical practice in the mid-nineteenth century.]},

@article{Grant2013,
 abstract = {[The music-theoretical formulations of the early modern
mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-83) are customarily
remembered—and often dismissed—for their unconventional rankings
of the consonances. A closer examination of Euler's writings,
however, reveals that he intended his theory of consonance to
assess and explain the interaction of rhythms as well as the
interaction of pitches. At several points in his 1739 Tentamen
novae theoriae musicae (Attempi at a New Theory of Music), Euler
suggests that everything he has written about consonance should
also apply to duration. Curiously, the transference of Euler's
consonance principles to the temporal elements of music renders
a theory that has interesting and provocative connections to
several contemporary theories of rhythm and meter, such as those
of Harald Krebs, Richard Cohn, Daphne Leong, and Scott Murphy.
This article sketches the theory of rhythm that Euler suggested
but never finished. The analytical applications of this model
are surprising and extend beyond the music of the eighteenth
century. Elaborating Euler's unfinished theory sheds light not
only on his work as a music theorist but also—and perhaps more
provocatively—un twenty-first-century music theory.]},

heritage and its reception in the early decades of the
eighteenth century. A section devoted to Maclaurin's monumental
Treatise of Fluxions (1742) describes its attempt to reach a
synthesis of the different strands of Newton's mathematical
legacy, and compares it with contemporary Continental work. It
is shown that in the middle of the eighteenth century academic

driven by local cultural assumptions in directions which

 abstract = {It is fairly well known that Darwin was inspired to formulate
his theory of natural selection by reading Thomas Malthus's
Essay on the Principle of Population. In fact, by reading
Darwin's notebooks, we can even locate one particular sentence
which started Darwin thinking about population and selection.
What has not been done before is to explain exactly where this
sentence - essentially Malthus's ideas about geometric
population growth - came from. In this essay we show that
eighteenth century mathematician Leonhard Euler is responsible
for this sentence, and in fact forms the beginning of the
logical chain which leads to the creation of the theory of
natural selection. We shall examine the fascinating path taken
by a mathematical calculation, the many different lenses
through which it was viewed, and the path through which it
eventually influenced Darwin.},

@article{Sato2015,
 abstract = {This paper explores the question of what makes diagrammatic
representations effective for human logical reasoning, focusing
on how Euler diagrams support syllogistic reasoning. It is
widely held that diagrammatic representations aid intuitive
understanding of logical reasoning. In the psychological
literature, however, it is still controversial whether and how
Euler diagrams can aid untrained people to successfully conduct
logical reasoning such as set-theoretic and syllogistic
reasoning. To challenge the negative view, we build on the
findings of modern diagrammatic logic and introduce an
Euler-style diagrammatic representation system that is designed
to avoid problems inherent to a traditional version of Euler
diagrams. It is hypothesized that Euler diagrams are effective
not only in interpreting sentential premises but also in
reasoning about semantic structures implicit in given sentences.
To test the hypothesis, we compared Euler diagrams with other
types of diagrams having different syntactic or semantic
properties. Experiment compared the difference in performance
between syllogistic reasoning with Euler diagrams and Venn
diagrams. Additional analysis examined the case of a linear
variant of Euler diagrams, in which set-relationships are
represented by one-dimensional lines. The experimental results
provide evidence supporting our hypothesis. It is argued that
the efficacy of diagrams in supporting syllogistic reasoning
crucially depends on the way they represent the relational
information contained in categorical sentences.},

dresser les caractéristiques essentielles de la dynamique de

des collègues de l'Académie royale des sciences de Paris, de
Leonhard Euler et des Bernoulli. Il apparaît que la publication
de 1743 renferme une approche de la dynamique originale et

The present article aims to precise some aspects of those
circumstances and to give essential characteristics of
D'Alembert's dynamics, in particular in the light of the works
led by some colleagues of the French Royal Academy of Sciences
and the works of Leonhard Euler and the Bernoulli. D'Alembert
published in 1743 a book with an original and specific approach

@article{Stigler2007,
 abstract = {[At a superficial level, the idea of maximum likelihood must be
prehistoric: early hunters and gatherers may not have used the
words ``method of maximum likelihood'' to describe their choice
of where and how to hunt and gather, but it is hard to believe
they would have been surprised if their method had been
described in those terms. It seems a simple, even unassailable
idea: Who would rise to argue in favor of a method of minimum
likelihood, or even mediocre likelihood? And yet the
mathematical history of the topic shows this ``simple idea'' is
really anything but simple. Joseph Louis Lagrange, Daniel
Bernoulli, Leonard Euler, Pierre Simon Laplace and Carl
Friedrich Gauss are only some of those who explored the topic,
not always in ways we would sanction today. In this article,
that history is reviewed from back well before Fisher to the
time of Lucien Le Cam's dissertation. In the process Fisher's
unpublished 1930 characterization of conditions for the
consistency and efficiency of maximum likelihood estimates is
presented, and the mathematical basis of his three proofs
discussed. In particular, Fisher's derivation of the information
inequality is seen to be derived from his work on the analysis
of variance, and his later approach via estimating functions was
derived from Euler's Relation for homogeneous functions. The
reaction to Fisher's work is reviewed, and some lessons drawn.]},

@article{Usitalo2011,
 abstract = {[This article examines the eighteenth-century elevation of
Mikhail Lomonosov to the role, vastly embellished over the
subsequent two centuries, of a pioneering chemist and physicist
and, more significantly, the father of Russian 'science.' This
process of myth generation began with Lomonosov's own efforts to
fashion himself into a celebrated natural philosopher.
Lomonosov's self-fashioning was interwoven, even initially
achieved, by his deft manipulation of patronage. My analysis
explores Lomonosov's efforts to promote his socio-professional
status as a natural philosopher at the St. Petersburg Academy of
Sciences and examines the methods he employed to advance the
social standing of this yet ill-defined vocation; one which had
no discernible prestige or rank. To secure for himself status at
the Academy of Sciences, Lomonosov vigorously sought to
associate his name and works with two of the most renowned
natural philosophers of the day, both intimately tied to the
Academy's early history: Leonhard Euler and Christian Wolff.
Within Russia, these aims were achieved; both Euler and Wolff
are thoroughly linked in Russian, Soviet, and Post-Soviet
historical discourse to the progression of Lomonosov's literal
(and intellectual) path from peasant to scientist. Lomonosov's
image as the founder of Russia's 'first chemical laboratory' -
attached to the Academy of Sciences, as the ' first' indigenous
professor of Russian chemistry, and, most importantly, as the
developer of a Russian 'community of scientists' and as an
apparent inspiration to generations of later, again Russian,
scientists, as first elaborated by Lomonosov in the eighteenth
century, is secure.]},

@article{Verdun2013,
 abstract = {[Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) published two lunar theories in 1753
and 1772. He also published lunar tables in 1745, 1746,
and—anonymously—in 1750. There are notebook records, unpublished
manuscripts, and manuscript fragments by Euler reflecting the
development of his lunar theories between about 1725 until about
1752. These documents might be used to reconstruct Euler's
theory on which he based his calculations of those lunar tables
and to analyze the development of his lunar theories within this
time span. The results of this analysis will be published here
in three parts representing three stages of Euler's research on
this topic: First approaches (about 1725–1730), developing the
methods (about 1730–1744), and the breakthrough (about
1744–1752). In this part, I analyze Euler's manuscripts and,
predominantly, Euler's records of his first two notebooks
written between 1725 and 1730. I found that his early
theoretical approach is coined by his development of analytical
(rational) mechanics of punctiform bodies moved by central
forces. He tried to describe the Moon's motion in terms of two
simultaneously acting centripetal forces, Huygens' centrifugal
theorem, and associated osculating radii.]},
